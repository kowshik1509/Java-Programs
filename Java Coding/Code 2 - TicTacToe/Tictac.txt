This Java program implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where a
 human player competes against an AI using the minimax algorithm 
 with alpha-beta pruning. The game board is represented by a 1D array
  of characters, where each cell can be filled with 'X' (human player),
   'O' (AI), or '-' (empty).
