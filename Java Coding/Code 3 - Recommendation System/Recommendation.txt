The provided code is a simple yet effective movie recommendation
 system that suggests up to five movies based on the user's preferred 
 genreâ€”either "Sci-Fi" or "Action." The program works by first filtering 
 movies from a predefined list that match the user's input genre. 
 If there are fewer than five recommendations available in the selected
  genre, the system supplements the list with movies from an alternative
   genre to ensure that the user receives a full set of recommendations.
